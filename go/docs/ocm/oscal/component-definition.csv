A human readable name for the component.,A description of the component including information about its function.,A category describing the purpose of the component. ALLOWED VALUES interconnection:software:hardware:service:physical:process-procedure:plan:guidance:standard:validation:,A list of textual labels that uniquely identify the controls or statements that the component implements.,A textual label that uniquely identifies a policy (desired state) that can be used to reference it elsewhere in this or other documents.,A description of the policy (desired state) including information about its purpose and scope.,Directory Name to identify Policy Resoure,A textual label that uniquely identifies the parameter associated with that policy (desired state) or controls implemented by the policy (desired state).,A description of the parameter including the purpose and use of the parameter.,ONLY for the policy (desired state) parameters: A value or set of values the parameter can take. The catalog parameters values are defined in the catalog. ,"A value recommended by Compliance Team in this profile for the parameter of the control or policy (desired state). If a CIS-benchmark exists, the default default could be the CIS-benchmark recommanded value.",A URL reference to the source catalog or profile for which this component is implementing controls for. A profile designates a selection and configuration of controls from one or more catalogs,A description of the profile.,A list of URL references that contain the Actual State Data Model (eg schema or swager API or procedure template or terraform schema). Needed by the fetcher developer. ,A TimeToLive value of the duration of time the actual state is valid before it becomes stale or obsolite or overriden. Needed by the fetcher developer. ,A textual label that uniquely identifies a check of the policy (desired state) that can be used to reference it elsewhere in this or other documents.,A description of the check of the policy (desired state) including the method (interview or examine or test) and procedure details.,A textual label that uniquely identifies a collector of the actual state (evidence) associated with the policy (desired state) that can be used to reference it elsewhere in this or other documents.,A description of the collector of the actual state (evidence) associated with the policy (desired state) including the method (interview or examine or API) and questionaire or API details.,A textual label that uniquely identifies the fix of the failed policy.,A description of the fix to remediate the failed policy.,Indicates the degree to which the a given policy is implemented. ALLOWED VALUES: IMPLEMENTED: The control is fully implemented. PARTIAL: The control is partially implemented. PLANNED: There is a plan for implementing the control as explained in the remarks. ALTERNATIVE: There is an alternative implementation for this control as explained in the remarks. NOT-APPLICABLE: This control does not apply to this system as justified in the remarks.,A URL reference to the Plan of Action and Milestones this component may be subjected to for remediation or deviation or mitigation in case of the policy (desired state) non compliance or error or failure. ,"A namespace qualifying the property's name. This allows different organizations to associate distinct semantics with the same name. Used in conjunction with ""class"" as the ontology concept. "
